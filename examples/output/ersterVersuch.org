* This is the output of the scheduler simulation.
** About the scheduling processing method
The simulation used the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm.
Switching processes costs 0 time units.
** Averages
The average waiting time for the processes is 14.4.
The average turnaround time for the processes is 21.4.
The average reaction time for the processes is 14.4.
