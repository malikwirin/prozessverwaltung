* This is the output of the scheduler simulation.
** About the scheduling processing method
The simulation used the Preemptive Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.
Switching processes costs 10 time units.
** Averages
The average waiting time for the processes is 35.8.
The average turnaround time for the processes is 42.8.
The average reaction time for the processes is 28.8.
